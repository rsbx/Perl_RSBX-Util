=head1 NAME

RSBX::Util::PseudoRandomSequenceGenerator - Produces sequences of pseudo-random values.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use RSBX::Util::PseudoRandomSequenceGenerator;
 ...
 $Agen = RSBX::Util::PseudoRandomSequenceGenerator->NewStringGenerator(
         8,    # "digits"
         16,   # base
         );
 ...
 $Sgen = RSBX::Util::PseudoRandomSequenceGenerator->NewStringGenerator(
         8,
         [split('', '0123456789ABCDEF'), 'Pre-', '-Post'],
         );
 ...
 @array = $Agen->Next();
 ...
 $string = $Sgen->Next();
 ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Produces sequences of pseudo-random values.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=over 4

=item NewArrayGenerator ( I<digits> , I<base> [, OPTIONS ] )

Create a pseudo-random array sequence generator.

=over 4

=item PARAMETERS

=over 4

=over 4

=item I<digits>

The size of each generated array.  Each array value being the corresponding I<digit>.

=item I<base>

The numeric base.  Each generated I<digit> will have a value constrained to: C<0 E<lt>= > I<digit> C<E<lt> > I<base>.

=back

=back

=item OPTIONS

=over 4

=over 4

=item C<'ZeroFirst'> =E<gt> C<1>

The first pseudo-random array sequence value generated will be an array of C<0>s.

=item C<'CisOne'> =E<gt> C<1>

Generate sequence values in counter mode.  Sequence values will be I<much>
easier to predict if this option is given.

=item C<'NoShuffle'> =E<gt> C<1>

This option disables the use of a fixed random mapping of internal generator
state to generated "digit" order.

=back

=back

=item RETURNS

An initialized pseudo-random array sequence generator object if there were no errors. Or C<undef> if there was an error.

=back

=item NewStringGenerator ( I<digits> , I<digits2string_array_ref> [, OPTIONS ] )

Create a pseudo-random string sequence generator.

=over 4

=item PARAMETERS

=over 4

=over 4

=item I<digits>

The number of "digits" each generated string will contain.

=item I<digits_2_string_array_ref>

Reference to an array containing the mapping from "digit" values to the
corresponding string representation, and string prefix and postfix values.

The I<base> for the pseudo-random string sequence generator is the array
length minus 2.  The first I<base> values in the array being the string
representation of the corresponding "digit" value.  The last 2 array values
are the output string prefix and postfix string values.

=back

=back

=item OPTIONS

=over 4

=over 4

=item C<'ZeroFirst'> =E<gt> C<1>

The first pseudo-random string sequence value generated will correspond to
all "digits" having the value C<0>.

=item C<'CisOne'> =E<gt> C<1>

Generate sequence values in counter mode.  Sequence values will be I<much>
easier to predict if this option is given.

=item C<'NoShuffle'> =E<gt> C<1>

This option disables the use of a fixed random mapping of internal generator
state to generated "digit" order.

=back

=back

=item RETURNS

An initialized pseudo-random string sequence generator object if there were no errors. Or C<undef> if there was an error.

=back

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item Next ( )

Returns the next array or string pseudo-random sequence value;

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

None.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over 4

=item RSBX::Util::Math::isCoprime

=item RSBX::Util::Math::isInteger

=back

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

None known.

Please report problems to Raymond S Brand E<lt>rsbx@acm.orgE<gt>.

Problem reports without included demonstration code and/or tests will be ignored.

Patches are welcome.

=head1 THEORY OF OPERATION

Internally, it is a linear congruential generator with:

=over 4

=item *

The I<multiplier> set to C<1>

=item *

The I<initial state> chosen randomly, unless the C<'ZeroFirst'> option was
given to the constructor.

=item *

The I<increment> chosen randomly but contrained to be coprime to the
I<modulus>. Unless the C<'CisOne'> option was given to the constructor, in
which case the I<increment> is C<1>.

=back

To further increase the perception of sequence randomness, there is also a
fixed random shuffling of the digit positions on output, unless the
C<'NoShuffle'> option was given to the constructor.
